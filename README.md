# Storybook Example

This is an example of React components orgnized in Storybook with documentation / README addon integration.

To get started....

```
$ npm install
$ npm run storybook
```

In a real world application components would be organized into directories containing all required files and assets including a `stories.js` file. However this simple example utilizes the `create-react-app` demo Button component so check out `src/stories/index.js` for setup and configuration.
